"FutureTech Summit 2025" is a clean, responsive, and modern event landing page. The structure of the HTML is semantic and organized into sections that include a hero header, speaker showcase, agenda breakdown, ticketing information, venue details, and a footer. Each section is styled to stand out visually and function well across devices.

The hero section uses a striking linear gradient background in dark blue tones, with white text for contrast and a bright yellow call-to-action (CTA) button that encourages visitors to get tickets. The speakers section presents individual speaker profiles in a grid layout that adapts to screen size, each styled as a card with a shadow effect, rounded corners, and consistent spacing to enhance readability and visual appeal.

Following this, the agenda section is also designed using CSS Grid to display three days of scheduled events. Each day is presented in a box-style format with a light background and list of sessions, maintaining consistent padding, shadows, and rounded edges. The ticket section features a centered content block styled similarly to previous sections, with pricing information and another CTA button, this time styled in blue to match the siteâ€™s color palette.

The venue section is simple and centered, displaying the location details and a responsive image placeholder styled with rounded corners. The footer concludes the page with a dark blue background, contact details, and sponsor logos arranged in a horizontal layout, maintaining visual consistency with the header.

Overall, the CSS uses modern techniques like CSS Grid and responsive design principles. It includes hover effects for interactivity, accessible font sizes, and semantic elements for improved structure and SEO. The design choices emphasize clarity, usability, and brand consistency across all sections.
